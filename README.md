1. Rock Paper Permutation
Given a number of rounds n, return all the possible rock-paper-scissors play possibilities for that number of rounds.

2. All anagrams
Given a single input string, write a function that produces all possible anagrams of a string and outputs them as an array. At first, donâ€™t worry about repeated strings. What time complexity is your solution?
