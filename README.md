1. Rock Paper Permutation
Given a number of rounds n, return all the possible rock-paper-scissors play possibilities for that number of rounds.

2. All anagrams
Given a single input string, write a function that produces all possible anagrams of a string and outputs them as an array. At first, donâ€™t worry about repeated strings. What time complexity is your solution?


3. Balanced Parenthesis
Given a string, return true if it contains balanced parenthesis ().

4. Common Characters
Write a function that accepts two strings as arguments, and returns only the characters that are common to both strings.

Your function should return the common characters in the same order that they appear in the first argument. Do not return duplicate characters and ignore whitespace in your returned string.

Example: commonCharacters('acexivou', 'aegihobu')

Returns: 'aeiou'
