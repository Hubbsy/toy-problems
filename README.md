1. Rock Paper Permutation
Given a number of rounds n, return all the possible rock-paper-scissors play possibilities for that number of rounds.

2. All anagrams
Given a single input string, write a function that produces all possible anagrams of a string and outputs them as an array. At first, don’t worry about repeated strings. What time complexity is your solution?


3. Balanced Parenthesis
Given a string, return true if it contains balanced parenthesis ().

4. Common Characters
Write a function that accepts two strings as arguments, and returns only the characters that are common to both strings.

Your function should return the common characters in the same order that they appear in the first argument. Do not return duplicate characters and ignore whitespace in your returned string.

Example: commonCharacters('acexivou', 'aegihobu')

Returns: 'aeiou'

5. Coin Sums
In England the currency is made up of pound, £, and pence, p, and there are eight coins in general circulation:

1p
2p
5p
10p
20p
50p
£1 (100p)
£2 (200p)
Given a given number of pence, return the possible number of ways someone could make change.

It is possible to make 5 pence in the following ways:

5 * 1p

3 * 1p + 1 * 2p

1 * 1p + 2 * 2p

1 * 5p
In other words, find all the possible combinations of coins that sum to a given pence value.

6.  Linked List
Implement a linked-list
